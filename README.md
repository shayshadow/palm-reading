## ✨ Key Features

### 🖐️ AI Real-Time Palm Analysis (VLM)
The vision model detects and evaluates the four major palm lines:

- **Life Line** – Vitality and physical resilience  
- **Heart Line** – Emotional intelligence and soul connections  
- **Head Line** – Strategic thinking and mental clarity  
- **Fate Line** – Professional destiny and social impact

- Palm traits extracted by the VLM are injected as **background context**
- The Archmage cites concrete evidence during dialogue  
  > “I see the *Strategic Mind* trait in thy Head Line, suggesting a path toward leadership…”

### 🍀 Mystical Metadata & Action Items

Each user receives a personalized **Destiny Profile**, including:

- **Lucky Context**  
  - Power Animal  
  - Lucky Color  
  - Divine Number
- **Action Item**  
  A specific task for the day to align your Qi with the stars

## 🪐 The Magic of Gemini (AI Strategy)

Palmystic implements a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Lite** architecture:

1. **Visual Extraction**  
   Palm images are converted into a structured **JSON schema** of mystical traits.

2. **Contextual Memory**  
   The JSON is stored in session context and passed to the LLM at every chat turn.

3. **Persona Consistency**  
   Strict system prompting ensures:
   - The Archmage stays in character
   - Interpretations remain grounded in extracted palm features

---

## ⚔️ Challenges & How We Overcame Them

- **Palm Image Validity**  
  Palm readings are highly sensitive to image orientation, framing, and clarity.  
  Instead of relying on brittle heuristics, we enforced strict validation rules at the **prompt level**, instructing the Gemini VLM to reject invalid inputs and return structured error responses.

- **Browser Image Transmission**  
  Camera-captured images initially failed to reach the backend correctly due to format mismatches.  
  We resolved this by converting Canvas output into binary **Blob** objects and transmitting them via multipart form data, ensuring compatibility with Spring controllers.

- **Persona Consistency**  
  Maintaining a mystical yet structured AI persona required careful prompt engineering.  
  We solved this with strict system prompts and schema-based outputs to balance creativity with reliability.
